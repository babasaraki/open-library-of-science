This repository aims to promote academic publishing in natural and life sciences :hosted in the OLS platform domain (that we choose to be www.openlibscien.org) for promoting academic. The Open Library of Science (OLS) can either publish or fund a journal to become fully gold open-access with no author-facing charges. We will welcome applications from any journals that meet the following requirements:-

- Are peer reviewed.
- Are academic journals based in either Nigeria or abroad
- Have been established for at least five years.
- Are currently funded through a subscription model.
- Are based in a sciences discipline, as self-defined by authors and editors.
- Have an international editorial board.
In addition, we will have a preference for journals that are owned by a learned society. If your journal meets the above requirements, we would be very happy to discuss options to take on publication ourselves by OLS.
